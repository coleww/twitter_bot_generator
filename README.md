#### I GENERATE TWITTER BOTS! RUBY IS JOY!

## Installation

    $ gem install twitter_bot_generator

## Usage

    $ twitter_bot_generator yr_bot_name_snake_case_style_yes

This will create a skeleton class named YrBotNameSnakeCaseStyleYes, some smokescreen minitest::unit tests, and a variety of other "ruby app on free heroku instance" boiler plate.

You will need to manually set the config variables with yr twitter api keys on heroku for deployment. For development I recommend writing some minitests or just doing it manually on the command line if the bot is simple enough. Testing the bot "live" can run into potential "twitter banning yr bot before

This gem was made for use in the twitter-art-robot-[tutorial](http://github.com/coleww/twitter-art-tutorial) and more details and documentation and such will be there when things happen. :dancers:
